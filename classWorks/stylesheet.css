/*css -- Stands for cascading style sheet 
similar to HTML
selector, property, values
ex : h1{color:red;} , h1-> selector; color:red; (property:value;) pair

Always make a different .css file and link it back to the webpage you want to style. This way we can make sure 
that if there are multiple webpages we can style them in same manner and at once.

To link CSS to an HTML file, we use the <link> tag that you put in the HTML’s <head> section. The link will look 
like this.In the header section,
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="stylesheet.css" media="screen"/>
</head>
Here’s a breakdown of the attributes contained within the link:

rel — defines the relationship between the file that hosts this command and the file defined in the href attribute. 
The standard value for this attribute is stylesheet.
type — defines the content of the linked file. In this tutorial, we set this attribute’s value to text/css. 
However, you can skip it altogether if you’re using HTML5.
href — specifies the location of the CSS file you want to link to the HTML. If the CSS file is in the same
directory as the HTML file, you only need to enter the file name. Otherwise, you need to include the folder 
name in which you store the CSS file (example: CSS/stylesheet.css).
media — specifies the type of media the CSS rules are optimized for. In this tutorial, we use the screen value to 
imply its use for computer screens. If you want to apply the CSS rules to printed pages, you can set the value to print.
Once you’ve included the above link in your HTML file, save the changes and enter your website’s URL in the browser. 
Styles written in the CSS file should change the look of your website.
