HTML -- HyperText Markup Language
Markup -- Only deals with formaatted layout and structure eg. LaTex ia a Markup Language
Webpage interprets HTML displays formatted web page

HTML was first developed in 1991.
First standarized version was i9n 1995 which was HTML2. We are currently on HTML5.

Format: Elements(Tags), Attributes, Values
<title>CapitalOne</title>  ---> <title> is element and CapitalOne is value.

Tags always must have opening tags but not necessarily the closing tags. eg. <br> break line tag does not have closing tag.
Attributes are always in (attribute name , attribute value) pair, attribute name = "attribute value", attribute values are always enclosed in quotes. There is no comma separation between attributes. Just use white space.

HTML ignores white spaces and its case insensitive, but always use small letters for convention! If you want a new line, you should use <br> break line tag! Anything inside body will be inline or in a single line unless we break it.

It's always a good practice to use target ="_blank" attribute while using href to insert an link which forces the link to be opened in new window.

It's always a good practice to use image height and width attributes while using img tag.

Always specify the language using lang attribute: <html lang="en"> </html>

You can get html template by following these steps: 1) open a sublime text editor 2) save file as .html 3) juts type html and hit a tab. 4) It will give you the html template.

HTML Entities
Some characters are reserved in HTML.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

A character entity looks like this:

&entity_name;

OR

&#entity_number;

eg. &lt or &#60 ; is used to write < in HTML. Similarly, &gt; (>), &nbsp(no breaking space,put them always together in same line eg. $10),&amp; (&), &quot;(" "), &apos;(apostrophe), &copy;(Copyright)

Combining Diacritical Marks
A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.

Some diacritical marks, like grave (  ̀) and acute (  ́) are called accents.

Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.

Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.

Here are some examples:

Mark	Character	Construct	Result
 ̀			a			a&#768;		à
 ́			a			a&#769;		á
̂			a			a&#770;		â
 ̃			a			a&#771;		ã
 ̀			O			O&#768;		Ò
 ́			O			O&#769;		Ó
̂			O			O&#770;		Ô
 ̃			O			O&#771;		Õ
