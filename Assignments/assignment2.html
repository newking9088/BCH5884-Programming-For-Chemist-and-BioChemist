		<h1>Introduction to Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn Superconductor</h1>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>As the first superconductor that demonstrated the capability to carry high loss-less current
at high magnetic fields, Nb3Sn is known as the material that transformed superconductivity
from a scientific curiosity to an area of significant practical importance by opening the door to
high-field magnet applications. Although the last few decades witnessed the domination of
the ductile Nb-Ti in superconducting magnet market, in recent years massive use of Nb3Sn has
expanded dramatically as fields beyond the limit of Nb-Ti are needed. As an example, over 500
tonnes of Nb3Sn strands were procured by the international thermonuclear experimental reactor
(ITER) project from 2008 to 2015, driving a ten-fold increase of worldwide Nb3Sn production
capability. With critical temperature (Tc) up to 18.3 K, upper critical field (Bc2) around 30 T,
and high critical current density (Jc) at high fields (e.g., whole-wire Jc of 1000 A/mm2
at 4.2 K,
15 T), Nb3Sn fills the gap between Nb-Ti and the costly and not-yet-mature high temperature
superconductors (HTS).
Current and potential application areas of Nb3Sn superconductors include: dipole and
quadrupole magnets for particle accelerators, central solenoids (CS) and toroidal field (TF) coils
in tokamak fusion devices (such as ITER), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), and laboratory-used high-field magnets including hybrid
magnets, and so on. Non-magnet applications, such as superconducting radio frequency (SRF)
cavities, are also promising.
For all magnet applications, high Jc is an important requirement in order to make magnets
compact and economical. Apart from high Jc, the critical operation conditions of
superconducting magnets put several other requirements on Nb3Sn superconductors. First, to
combat instability, Nb3Sn conductors are typically produced in the form of round wires, each
comprised of a plurality of fine superconducting units (“filaments” or “subelements”) embedded
in a Cu matrix. Two parameters have been found critical for the electromagnetic stability of
superconductors: the subelement size dsub, and the thermal conductivity of the Cu matrix, which
at low temperatures is sensitive to its purity. The latter is gauged by the residual resistivity ratio
(RRR) usually defined as the electrical resistivity at 273 K divided by that at 20 K. Small
filament size and high RRR are desired for Nb3Sn stability [8,9]. Second, to reduce field-ramprate-dependent a.c. loss, the superconductors should have small filament size and the filaments
should be twisted. Third, reduction of the parasitic magnetic field produced by screening current
induced by external magnetic field also requires small d<sub>sub</sub>. A summary of the requirements
on Nb3Sn conductors for different applications is shown in Table I. Apart from requirements on
Jc and dsub, all applications require high RRR and good stress/strain tolerance as well.

		<h1>History of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn Superconductor Development</h1>
		<div class="history">
			<p>
			During the 1960’s through the 1980’s programs in the US
and Europe developed Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn magnet models as an alternative
to NbTi. As early as 1967, a 20 cm long Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn quadrupole
magnet was built and tested at BNL using Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn react and
wind tape. The magnet had a wide 70 cm bore and achieved a
gradient of 85 T/m, with 3 T peak field in the conductor and
400 A/mm<sub>2</sub>
 critical current. Later in 1979, 80 mm
aperture dipoles were made with react and wind “Isabelle
braid” cables achieving bore fields comparable to Tevatron
NbTi dipoles at (4.8T at 4.6K) and could operate in helium
gas at lower fields up to 17 K. At CEN/Saclay, a twolayer dipole, similar in design to the Tevatron arc dipole
achieved 6 T. While these magnets demonstrated promise
of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn, NbTi magnets with comparable or better field and
quench performance were chosen for large-scale projects.
In the 1980’s interest in Nb3Sn magnets was renewed with
the proposal to replace the LEP electron/positron ring with a
hadron collider. There were two competing ideas for the
upgrade, one was to make Nb3Sn magnets operating at 4.2 K,
the other was to make NbTi magnets operating in superfluid.
The former involved continue R&D in Nb3Sn while the latter
required a significant cryogenic upgrade for CERN. Through
a collaboration of ELIN and CERN, model dipole coils using
the wind and react technology, culminating the successful
construction of a 10.5 T dipole. Despite these successes,
the decision was to made to adopt the NbTi at 1.9K
approach.
In the 1990s, Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn research in “LHC” type dipoles was
largely centered in Twente and LBL, with significant progress
made in quench and mechanical performance. Both programs
utilized a “cosine ” design with wind and react Rutherford
cables. In 1997 Twente reported a record field of of 11 T followed the later that year by a 12.8 T at 4.4K
and 13.5 T at 1.8K.
Perhaps bolstered by these results as well as the
requirements for future accelerators requirements, several
institutions started or rejoined their efforts in the Nb3Sn
magnet technology towards the end of the decade and into the
present, including Fermilab, TAMU, BNL, as well at LBL,
Saclay and University of Twente. </p>

		Linear or hadron synchrotron accelerators and even a
hydrotest facility.
The most immediate goals for energy and lumpiest are set
by the world’s future largest hadron collider, the LHC.
The LHC will collide 7 TeV x 7TeV protons with a maximum
design luminosity of 1034 cm<sup>-2</sup>. Operation of this machine
requires dipoles and quadruples of 50-70 mm apertures with
peak bore fields of 8.4 T and gradients of 220 T/m. These
magnets have a peak field in the conductor of approximately
9-10 T which can be accomplished by utilizing NbTi
conductor operating in superfluid. After a long technology
development program, all the magnets for the LHC are in
production.
Already there are discussions for upgrades for this machine
as well as plans for a possible Very Large Hadron Collider
(VLHC), colliding protons at several hundred TeV center of
mass energy. Upgrades for the LHC in the 10-15 year horizon
center around improving the luminosity by a factor of two by
increasing the machine’s. One scenario calls for
replacing the first generation LHC IR 70 mm quadrupoles
with a larger 90 mm aperture quadrupole with the same
gradient. The time scale for an energy upgrade for the
LHC is further in the future, and would require replacing the
arc dipoles with magnets with field of  &gt; 17 T along with a
correspondingly strong arc quadrupole
 The VLHC is being considered for this longer 20-30 year
time frame. In 2000, a VLHC study group was formed, and
after a several month design study, a report was written on a
possible VLHC. In order to reach a collision energy of
several hundred TeV, a 233 km circumference tunnel was
proposed. Figure in left shows a possible tunnel layout. The report
suggests that the following general principles are needed for
accelerator magnets to reach these highest energies:
1)operating field range up to 10 T for both arc and DS
dipoles, 2) gradients of 45-400 T/m for arc and DS,
quadrupoles, with coil apertures  &gt; 40 mm sufficient for beam
screen and vacuum pipes, 3) finally the magnet must be robust
and must come an affordable price. For more reading <a href="https://fs.magnet.fsu.edu/~lee/superconductor-history_files/Centennial_Supplemental/11_3_Tachikawa+Lee-History_of_Nb3Sn_and_Related_A15_Wires.pdf" target="_blank">click here.</a>
